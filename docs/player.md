# Player (`assets/src/js/lib/player/`)

Preact player for the stream action (`views/action/stream_video.html`, `stream_audio.html`) and
the embed. This file covers the viewer-facing controls; subtitles and AI translation live in
`docs/subtitle_translate.md`, the track picker in `docs/uikit.html` §19.

## Controls and `features`

`parseFeatures` (`Player.jsx`) builds the defaults; an embed may override them through
`settings.features` (the share lock for ad-supported domains is described in the code).

| feature | default | what |
|---|---|---|
| `playpause`, `progress`, `duration`, `volume` | on | the basics |
| `speed` | on | playback speed (below) |
| `advancedtracks`, `fullscreen`, `chromecast`, `embed` | video only | |
| `share`, `logo`, `availableprogress` | see code | |

## Remembered settings — `player-prefs.js`

Volume, mute and playback speed are kept in `localStorage` (`wt-player-prefs`), per browser —
no server, no account. Storage is reached through `safeStorage()` only: in a sandboxed or
third-party iframe reading `window.localStorage` throws, and a player that cannot remember must
still play. Stored values are validated field by field on the way back in.

Restored in `usePlayerState` before the listeners go on. `muted` is restored only towards
silence, so a stored "unmuted" never overrides a stream the page started muted.

## Playback speed — `SpeedControl.jsx`

Scale `RATES` = 0.5 … 2. The button's face is the current rate and lights up when it is not 1×.
Video: a menu above the button — a `popover="manual"` placed by hand from the button's rect, because
`.wt-player` is `overflow: hidden` and on a phone the picture is shorter than the list; the top layer
also keeps it visible in fullscreen (no Popover API → in-flow fallback, clipped but usable). Audio:
the button steps through the scale and wraps — the audio player is one row tall.
Keys `<` / `>` step the rate. `defaultPlaybackRate` is set together with `playbackRate`: a
session seek reloads the source, and `load()` resets the rate to the default.

Not measured yet: whether the transcoder keeps ahead of a 2× viewer on a slow swarm.

## Double-tap to seek — `tap-seek.js`

Touch only (a click counts as a tap when a `touchstart` came within 800 ms before it; with a
mouse a double click stays fullscreen). Two quick taps on the same half of the picture seek
∓10 s through the ordinary `handleSeek`, and every further tap in the streak seeks again; the
feedback bubble shows the running total.

A side tap **waits** for the 300 ms window before it counts as a single tap (play/pause):
otherwise the first tap of a double pauses the film and the second resumes it — a stutter, and a
pair of play/pause events for everything that listens. A
waiting single that turns out not to be half of a double is delivered late, not dropped.

## Keys

space / `k` play-pause · ←/→ ∓15 s · ↑/↓ volume · `f` fullscreen · `m` mute · `<`/`>` speed.

## Loading spinner — `stall-watch.js`

The spinner follows the **clock and the frames**, not the media events. After a seek past the
buffer `waiting` may never fire, and `seeked` / `canplay` fire when the first fragment is in —
well before the picture moves again (first seconds of a film, buffer shorter than the 10 s of a
double tap). `usePlayerState` samples the element every animation frame:

- **Into a stall:** not paused, not ended, no session seek in flight, `currentTime` unchanged for
  `STALL_MS` (300 ms).
- **Out of it:** evidence of playback, not a changed number — hls.js nudges `currentTime` forward
  while it sits in a buffer hole, and the first version took a nudge for "moving". With a frame
  counter (`getVideoPlaybackQuality`, only when `videoWidth > 0`): `RECOVER_FRAMES` (3) frames
  presented since the stall began — one is not enough, a finished seek paints its target frame
  and stands. Without one (audio, old browsers): the clock advancing on every sample for
  `RECOVER_MS` (250 ms).
- While the watchdog says "stalled", `canplay` / `playing` do not take the spinner down.
