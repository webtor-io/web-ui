        <p>Vault is a storage system in Webtor that allows you to:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
            <li>save torrents for a long time,</li>
            <li>watch content without waiting for seeders,</li>
            <li>support needed torrents with points,</li>
            <li>have guaranteed access to files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Vault Points (VP)</h2>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>1 Vault Point = 1 GB</strong></li>
            <li>Points are provided as part of your subscription or other activities (the amount depends on your subscription tier)</li>
        </ul>

        {{ with .Data.Vault }}
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How saving to Vault works</h2>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Click the <strong>"Keep This Torrent Available"</strong> button next to the torrent you want to save.</li>
            <li>Confirm the number of points required (for example, if the torrent is 10 GB, you need to deposit 10 VP).</li>
            <li>The funded points are frozen for <strong class="font-bold">{{ .FreezePeriod | duration }}</strong>. The freeze is automatically lifted when the torrent is successfully transferred to the Vault.</li>
            <li>Webtor transfers the torrent to the Vault (if the transfer fails within <strong class="font-bold">{{ .TransferTimeoutPeriod | duration }}</strong>, VP is returned).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Claiming Vault Points back</h2>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Points can be claimed back if they are not frozen.</li>
            <li>If after claiming points back the amount is less than required to keep the torrent, it will be marked as expired and deleted after <strong class="font-bold">{{ .ExpirePeriod | duration }}</strong>.</li>
            <li>When a torrent is deleted, all pledges associated with it are also deleted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What if my subscription expires</h2>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Points that were invested in torrents lose their power and the torrent is marked as expired and deleted after <strong class="font-bold">{{ .ExpirePeriod | duration }}</strong>.</li>
            <li>If the subscription is renewed, the points become active again and the torrents funded by them are no longer expired.</li>
        </ul>

            <span>⚠️ Important: if a torrent is blocked by copyright holders or removed from public sources, it may disappear – Vault does not guarantee preservation in such cases.</span>
