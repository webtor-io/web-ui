    <h1 class="text-[clamp(2rem,4vw,2.8rem)] font-extrabold tracking-tight leading-tight mb-4">Vault</h1>

    <p class="text-[1.05rem] text-w-sub leading-relaxed mb-10">Vault is a storage system in Webtor that allows you to:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-[1.05rem] text-w-sub leading-relaxed">
        <li>save torrents for a long time,</li>
        <li>watch content without waiting for seeders,</li>
        <li>support needed torrents with points,</li>
        <li>have guaranteed access to files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-[1.3rem] font-bold tracking-tight mt-10 mb-3">Vault Points (VP)</h2>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-[1.05rem] text-w-sub leading-relaxed">
        <li><strong>1 Vault Point = 1 GB</strong></li>
        <li>Points are provided as part of your subscription or other activities (the amount depends on your subscription tier)</li>
    </ul>

    {{ with .Data.Vault }}
    <h2 class="text-[1.3rem] font-bold tracking-tight mt-10 mb-3">How saving to Vault works</h2>

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-[1.05rem] text-w-sub leading-relaxed">
        <li>Click the <strong>"Keep This Torrent Available"</strong> button next to the torrent you want to save.</li>
        <li>Confirm the number of points required (for example, if the torrent is 10 GB, you need to deposit 10 VP).</li>
        <li>The funded points are frozen for <strong>{{ .FreezePeriod | duration }}</strong>. The freeze is automatically lifted when the torrent is successfully transferred to the Vault.</li>
        <li>Webtor transfers the torrent to the Vault (if the transfer fails within <strong>{{ .TransferTimeoutPeriod | duration }}</strong>, VP is returned).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-[1.3rem] font-bold tracking-tight mt-10 mb-3">Claiming Vault Points back</h2>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-[1.05rem] text-w-sub leading-relaxed">
        <li>Points can be claimed back if they are not frozen.</li>
        <li>If after claiming points back the amount is less than required to keep the torrent, it will be marked as expired and deleted after <strong>{{ .ExpirePeriod | duration }}</strong>.</li>
        <li>When a torrent is deleted, all pledges associated with it are also deleted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-[1.3rem] font-bold tracking-tight mt-10 mb-3">What if my subscription expires</h2>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-[1.05rem] text-w-sub leading-relaxed">
        <li>Points that were invested in torrents lose their power and the torrent is marked as expired and deleted after <strong>{{ .ExpirePeriod | duration }}</strong>.</li>
        <li>If the subscription is renewed, the points become active again and the torrents funded by them are no longer expired.</li>
    </ul>
    {{ end }}

      <strong>Important:</strong> If a torrent is blocked by copyright holders or removed from public sources, it may disappear – Vault does not guarantee preservation in such cases.
